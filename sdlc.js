// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/


// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle 
    and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you. 
*/
const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which developers will define prototypes such as: system requirements, evaluate alternatives to existing prototypes, or perfrom research and analysis to determine the needs of the user. They will also create an SRS document which includes all specifications they plan to build"
const design = "This is the third step, developers will outline the details for the application along with specifc aspects such as: user interface, system interfaces, network requirements, and databases. They then turn their SRS document into a more logical structure that can later be implemented in a programming language. Operation, training, and maintenance plans will all be drawn up so that the developers know what they need to do throughout every stage of the cycle moving forward."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, this is the process developers undergo to configure and build the software for certain conditions of use."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, developers will have configured all individual software components, constructed, and tested them for bugs or improvements. The software will then be integrated into its environment and installed."
const maintain = "This is the sixth step, in which developers will now move into maintenance mode and begin practicing any activities require to handle issues reported by end-users. Developers are also responsible for implementing any changes that the software might need after deployment. This can include handling bugs that were not patchede before launch or resolving new issues."
